Transports

Transports are the methods in which logs are sent.

transports are good for several things: configuring a client for transportation, writing/sending the log/event, and returning statistical data about your run.

a transport class must return a client for feedr to use and be able to use that client to send a log generated by the formatter. returning statistical data isn't mandatory.. but recommended.

implementing new transports is as simple as implementing a transport - easy.

to see a list of all transports run:

.. code-block:: bash

 mouth list transports

.. note:: while some transports have a default configuration (like the File transport), some don't (like the UDP transport). see the `transports <http://feedr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/transports.html>`_ section for configuration options for the desired transport.
